## Table-top Copilot
I decided to repurpose this older repo for a newer project on modernizing the tech for virtual-table-top software. I find it to be an interesting case study in how LLMs can create big paradigm shifts in how to approach software projects.

Basically the original project for this repo (envisioned and attempted around 2021/2022 or so) was an attempt at coming up with a mix between a programming language, schema language, DBMS, and game engine that would be a sort of "digital native" format for tabletop roleplaying games. The purpose of which would be to fix an overbearing "reinventing the wheel" problem in virtual-tabletop software, as well as a conceptual gap in how to implement a comparatively squishy ttrpg versus a very well defined video game digitally.

This was made largely irrelevant by LLMs in 2023 by my estimation, and I think that VTTs/ttrpgs are just such a niche and small market that no one has thought to apply the technology to the domain beyond "chatgpt as a GM" or using generative assets.

The goal of this project now is an experiment for a VTT Copilot implemented via LLM. Specifically starting as a Foundry-VTT module.

## 2TML: Table-top Modelling Language (Outdated Title)

The mission of this project is a digital-native format and tooling for tabletop roleplaying games.
