## TODO: RIGHT NOW

### 1. pick a nim sqlite library (the less it does the better)
### 2. ensure the pairing allows all sqlite functionality to be used (fully expressive?)
### 3. search for nimble packages that might help
### 4. pull down nimble package for defining custom sqlite functions
### 5. once this is all configured save it as a quick start template, then start extending
	a. note, the nim build system and sqlite build system could be very important here
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
## TODO: DOWN THE RIGHT    
    
### THIS IS THE BIG ONE: RESEARCH THE C NIM COMPILES DOWN TO AND COMPATIBILITY WITH SQLITE
### If one could make a nim dialect capable of using the full or at least important parts of the sqlite api/abi one would be capable of extending sqlite in a high level language instead of C, which would be huge
